# Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

## Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that uses the IEEE 802.11 protocol. It allows electronic devices like smartphones, wearables, laptops, desktops, and other consumer electronics to connect to the Internet without physical cables.


### Operating bands

The AP6256 Wi-Fi chipset supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz operating bands.

### Operating modes

The Wi-Fi software operates in the following modes.

| Mode          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| STA mode      | In STA mode, a device connects to an AP within a Wi-Fi network and communicates with other devices in the network. This mode is standard for wireless devices in a Wi-Fi connection. |
| Hotspot mode  | The hotspot mode enables a device to provide backhaul (Internet) connectivity to Wi-Fi clients using a cellular link (LTE). The device establishes this connection through its lightweight hotspot interface. In hotspot mode, the device can communicate with other Wi-Fi clients connected to the same hotspot, communicate with the hotspot device, and share the WAN connection of the device. |

    <TabItem value="Wi-Fi STA" label="STA mode">
    In Station (STA) mode, the device can be connected to an existing Wi-Fi network to access network resources or the Internet. 

    1. Scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks using commands.

    ```shell
    nmcli dev wifi list 2>&1 | less
    ```
    ![](../images/image-143.jpg)

    :::note
    Type `q` to exit.
    :::
    2. Connect to a Wi-Fi network.
    ```shell
    sudo nmcli dev wifi connect <WiFi-SSID> password <WiFi-password>
    ```

    For example, run the following command.

    ```shell
    sudo nmcli dev wifi connect rubikpiwifi password 123456789
    ```

    `WiFi-SSID` is `rubikpiwifi` and `WiFi-password` is `123456789`

    Sample output:

    ```shell
    Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with 'e8b98f24-3f23-4742-8aa3-0d37c5ee6564'.
    ```

    :::note
    If you see a network error message when running the command, run one of the following commands to trigger a Wi-Fi scan and verify the target access point (AP).

    * `nmcli dev wifi list`

    * `iw dev wlan0 scan `       &#x20;
    :::
    3. Check the network status:

    ```shell
    nmcli general status
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```shell
    STATE  CONNECTIVITY  WIFI-HW  WIFI    WWAN-HW  WWAN
    connected  full     enabled  enabled  enabled  enabled
    ```
    4. To verify the network status, run the following command:
        1. Run the following command to check the device status.

        ```shell
        nmcli dev status
        ```

        Sample output:

        ```
        DEVICE  TYPE      STATE        CONNECTION

        can0    can       unmanaged    --
        lo      loopback  unmanaged    --
        ```
        2. Check the additional connection information.

        ```
        nmcli device show wlan0
        ```

        Sample output:

        ```
        GENERAL.DEVICE:                         wlan0

        ```
        3. Verify whether an IP address has been assigned to the wlan0 interface by running the `ifconfig wlan0` command in the UART console.

        ```
        ifconfig wlan0
        ```
        :::note
        
        Run the `sudo apt install net-tools` command to install the ifconfig command.
        :::

        4. Verify whether the AP or router is connected to the Internet by pinging the following public DNS IP address.

        ```
        ping 8.8.8.8
        ```
    :::note
     * If you have connected to a network but want to connect to another one, switch the connection off by specifying the SSID and running the command `nmcli con down  ssid/uuid`. If you have multiple connections with the same SSID, use the UUID.

    * To connect to another saved network, use the up option with the nmcli command-line tool by running the `nmcli con up ssid/uuid` command.

    <TabItem value="Wi-Fi AP" label="AP mode">

   In Access Point (AP) mode, namely, the wireless hotspot mode, the device becomes a gateway for other devices to connect to a network. The steps to create an AP are as follows:

    * Enable the AP.
        * Create or modify */opt/hostapd.conf*:

          ```plain&#x20;text
          ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd
          driver=nl80211
          ieee80211n=1
          interface=wlan1
          hw_mode=a
          channel=36
          beacon_int=100
          dtim_period=1
          ssid=RUBIKPi
          auth_algs=1
          ap_isolate=0
          ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
          wpa=2
          wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
          rsn_pairwise=CCMP
          wpa_passphrase=123456789
          ```

        * Run the following commands to enable the AP:

          ```shell
          hostapd -B /opt/hostapd.conf # Set the software AP
          # Enable the DHCP server
          brctl addbr br0
          brctl addif br0 wlan1
          ifconfig br0 192.168.225.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
          killall dnsmasq
          dnsmasq --conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq.conf --dhcp-leasefile=/var/run/dnsmasq.leases --addn-hosts=/data/hosts --pid-file=/var/run/dnsmasq.pid -i br0 -I lo -z --dhcp-range=br0,192.168.225.20,192.168.225.60,255.255.255.0,43200 --dhcp-hostsfile=/data/dhcp_hosts --dhcp-option-force=6,192.168.225.1 --dhcp-script=/bin/dnsmasq_script.sh
          ```

  *  Run the following command to establish a connection with `hostapd_cli`.

    ```shell
    hostapd_cli -i wlan1 -p /var/run/hostapd
    ```

  Monitor Wi-Fi STA connection notifications in the `hostapd_cli` console, such as `AP-STA-CONNECTED` and `EAPOL-4WAY-HS-COMPLETED`.

  Sample output:
  ```shell
  root@rubikpi:~# hostapd_cli -i wlanl -p /var/run/hostapd

  ```
 Before the AP 5G mode is enabled, if there has never been a connection to a 5G Wi-Fi network using STA, use the following command to check the 5G channel configuration in the environment:

  ```shll
  iw dev wlan0 scan
  ```
 In the command output, identify the currently active channel through the **primary channel** field. In the following example, the value of **primary channel** is **36**. Write **36** into the **channel** field in the */opt/hostapd.conf* file.


 ```
 HT operation:
                 * primary channel: 36
                 * secondary channel offset: above
                 * STA channel width: any
                 * RIFS: 0
                 * HT protection: nonmember
                 * non-GF present: 0
                 * OBSS non-GF present: 0
                 * dual beacon: 0
                 * dual CTS protection: 0
                 * STBC beacon: 0

                 * PCO active: 0
                 * PCO phase: 0
```
    * Verify AP

        To test the connection, connect to AP from other devices.

        For example, perform the following steps to connect to AP from a mobile device:

        1. On the mobile device, go to Wi-Fi settings.

        2. Wait for the Wi-Fi STA to detect AP.

        3. Select AP and type the corresponding `wpa_passphrase` configured for AP on your RUBIK Pi 3 device for connection.
   
        ```shell
        > status
        state=ENABLED
