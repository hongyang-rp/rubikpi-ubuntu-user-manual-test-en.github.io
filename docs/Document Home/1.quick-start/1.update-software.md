# Update software

This section describes how to download and flash the prebuilt images onto the RUBIIK Pi 3 device from different host computers running Ubuntu, Windows, or mac operating systems.

![](../images/diagram.jpg)

:::warning

 Updating the software with the prebuilt images erases all data on your device and installs a newer image. Ensure you back up important data before you start.
::: 

## Download software

Visit the [RUBIK Pi 3 official website](https://www.thundercomm.com/rubik-pi-3/en/docs/image) to download the Ubuntu 24.04 software version.

## Flash using the QDL tool

The Qualcomm Device Loader (QDL) tool is a flashing utility that can be used to flash images to RUBIK Pi 3.

Click [here](https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/api/download/software/tools/Qualcomm_Device_Loader/All/2.3.4/Qualcomm_Device_Loader.Core.2.3.4.All-AnyCPU-qdl_2.3.4.zip) to download QDL and decompress it. The contents of the package are as follows. QDL supports multiple platforms and architectures. For details about how to use QDL, refer to *QDL_User_Guide.pdf.*

<TabItem value="uhost" label="Ubuntu host">

1. Install libusb and libxml2 by executing the following command. (Skip this step if they are already installed.)

```shell
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

2. Go to the *ufs* directory of the FlatBuild package.

3. Based on the host architecture, copy the *qdl* from either the *QDL_Linux_x64* or *QDL_Linux_ARM* directory into the *ufs* directory.

4. Execute the following command to perform the flashing.

```shell
./qdl --storage ufs prog_firehose_ddr.elf rawprogram*.xml patch*.xml
```

![](../images/image-22.jpg)

5. If your RUBIK Pi 3 fails to boot up after flashing, click [here](https://thundercomm.s3.dualstack.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/web/rubik-pi-3/firmware/provision.zip) to download the provision file and reconfigure the UFS.

:::warning
 * After provisioning, some information stored in the UFS, such as the SN and Ethernet MAC address, may be lost.

 * Before configuration, copy the *qdl* from either the *QDL_Linux_x64* or *QDL_Linux_ARM* directory to the *provision* directory, depending on your host architecture.
::: 

Go to the folder of the provision file you downloaded and run the following command to reconfigure the UFS.

```shell
./qdl prog_firehose_ddr.elf provision_ufs_1_3.xml
```

![](../images/image-23.jpg)

:::note
 After provisioning, remove and plug in the power supply and USB cable to restart your RUBIK Pi 3 and perform the image flashing again.

<TabItem value="whost" label="Windows host">

1. Install the WinUSB driver. (Skip this step if it is already installed.)

   1. Uninstall any other driver programs for the device. Ensure that Qualcomm USB drivers or other drivers are not installed.

      * The RUBIK Pi device should not exist under the COM ports in Device Manager. If you see the device under the COM ports, right-click it and select **Uninstall device**.

      ![](../images/image-24.jpg)

      * Ensure that you check **Delete the driver software for this device**.

      ![](../images/image-25.jpg)

   2. Power off the device, then reenter flashing mode. Use the following instructions/screenshots to install the Microsoft WinUSB driver:

      * In Device Manager, right-click the USB port for RUBIK Pi 3 and select **Update driver**.

      ![](../images/image-26.jpg)

      * Select **WinUsb Device** under **Model.**

      ![](../images/image-27.jpg)

      * Click **Yes** to complete the driver update.

      ![](../images/image-28.jpg)

2. In the terminal, use the following command to run the QDL executable from either the *QDL_Win_x64* or *QDL_Win_ARM64* directory, based on your host architecture, to flash the image. The device will automatically reboot once the flashing is complete. Make sure you're in the *ufs* directory of the FlatBuild package.

:::note
 * The program file names do not support wildcards. The command must list each image file explicitly.
 
 * Replace `<pathToQDL>` with the actual location of the *QDL_Win_x64* or *QDL_Win_ARM64* directory.
::: 

```shell
<pathToQDL>\QDL.exe prog_firehose_ddr.elf rawprogram0.xml rawprogram1.xml rawprogram2.xml rawprogram3.xml rawprogram4.xml rawprogram5.xml rawprogram6.xml patch1.xml patch2.xml patch3.xml patch4.xml patch5.xml patch6.xml
```
