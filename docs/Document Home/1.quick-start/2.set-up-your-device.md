# Set up your device

You can seamlessly configure the RUBIK Pi 3 using hosts based on Ubuntu, Windows®, and macOS®

![](../images/20250728-152823.jpg)

:::note
Install the latest Ubuntu 24.04 operating system on your RUBIK Pi 3 based on the information provided in the [Update software](1.update-software.md) section.
:::

## Power on the device

:::danger[Warning:]

- Do not use a desktop or laptop computer to power your RUBIK Pi 3. This may cause damage to both the computer and the RUBIK Pi 3.
- Any external power supply used with the RUBIK Pi must comply with all applicable local laws and regulations.
- A **12 V DC power supply rated at ≥ 3 A** is required. The power supply should feature overcurrent, overvoltage, and surge protection.

:::

Connect a 12V 3A Type-C power adapter, then perform one of the following operations:

* Press and hold the power button for two seconds until the green LED blinks once.

* Plug in a USB Type-C to USB Type-A or a Type-C cable to establish an ADB connection and flash the software.

RUBIK Pi 3 supports Power Delivery (PD) 3.0 power input.
The power indicator LED near the power port will turn on if the power adapter meets requirements and power negotiation succeeds. If the adapter does not meet requirements, the LED will remain off and the device will not boot.

Board versions v02 and later support automatic power-on after the power adapter is connected. You can check the hardware version number at the following location on the board. In the example below, the hardware version is V02.

![](../images/20250728-124347.jpg)

If the blue LED on the board is constantly lit, it indicates that the power button was pressed for too long, and the board is in fastboot mode.

To exit fastboot mode, use one of the following methods:

1. Press **Enter** in the serial terminal.

2. On the host, enter the `fastboot reboot` command.

3. Unplug the power, and then restart the device.

## Connect to the network

Use one of the following methods to establish an Internet connection and obtain the device's IP address.

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="ETH" label="Use an Ethernet connection">

1. Connect one end of an Ethernet cable to the Ethernet port (RJ45) on your RUBIK Pi 3, and the other end to the network router.

![](../images/image-5.jpg)

2. After establishing the connection, run the following command on the UART serial console to obtain the IP address:

    ```shell
    ip addr
    ```

    ![](../images/image-6.jpg)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="WiFi" label="Use a Wi-Fi connection">

The device is running in Station mode for Wi-Fi. When the device boots up, it initializes the Wi-Fi host driver and performs network management authentication. Users can establish a wireless connection using the nmcli command-line tool.

1. Run the following command to connect to the wireless access point (Wi-Fi router):

   ```shell
   nmcli dev wifi connect <WiFi-SSID> password <WiFi-password>
   ```

    Example

    ```
    nmcli dev wifi connect RUBIKPiWiFi password 1234567890
    ```
    ```
    Device 'wlan0' successfully activated with 'd7b990bd-3b77-4b13-b239-b706553abaf8'.
    ```

2. Run the following command to verify the connection and device status:

      ```shell
      nmcli -p device
      ```

    ![](../images/image-7.jpg)

3. Run the following command to verify the WLAN connection status and IP address.

    ```shell
    ip addr
     ```

     ![](../images/image-8.jpg)

4. To ensure the connection is active, perform a ping operation to a website such as that of RUBIK Pi:

     ```shell
    ping rubikpi.ai
     ```
 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Connect to SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) is used for secure file transfer between the host and RUBIK Pi.

Before connecting to SSH, ensure that the network connection is established.

1. To find the RUBIK Pi's IP address based on the network connection type, run the following command in the UART console:

   ```shell
   ip addr
   ```

2. Run the following command from the host to establish an SSH connection with the device. Use the IP address obtained in step 1.

   ```shell
   ssh <user name>@ip-address
   ```

    Example:
    ```
    ssh ubuntu@192.168.0.222
    ```

3. To connect to SSH, enter the user's password when prompted.

:::note

Ensure that the host is connected to the same Wi-Fi access point as the device.
